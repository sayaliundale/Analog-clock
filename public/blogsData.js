        <p><strong>Android or Web?</strong> So basically, I will say that totally is an independent choice. <em>In what does your interests lies? So here are some questions that will let you decide your priorities???</em></p>
        <p><br/></p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Am I a newbie?</p>
        </li>

        <li><p>What will guarantee me an excellent placement?</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Do I love intensive programming? How far I am willing to go?</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>What is easy to learn. What is in more demand (Android | Web)?</p>
        </li>

        <p>So here are the <strong>6 factors</strong> that I have listed out that will let you compare, what you want to choose Web Development / Android Development. Let’s Go!!!</p>
        <p><br/></p>
        <h2 id="learning-curve-what-s-easy-">Learning Curve (What’s Easy)</h2>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p>Funny fact!!! You have to learn both😂. Let’s differentiate according to the complexity of the projects you want to build.</p>
        <p><strong>Simple Android Project</strong> → For building a simple Android Project you basically need Android Studio Software. Download an Emulator if you want. You additionally have to setup the libraries &amp; sdk files.</p>
        <p><strong>PS</strong> — Need a high end laptop<em>(explained further) , Learn Java, Kotlin or Dart</em>.</p>
        <p><strong>Simple Web Project</strong> → You just need a simple Notepad &amp; a simple browser for web development. Save it using .html extension and BOOM💥. You have created your first web development project. Add a little CSS to make it look beautiful.</p>
        <p><strong>Additionally</strong> → For Android development you have to be updated with the new android system updates, otherwise your apps would be deprecated on play store.
        For advance Web projects you have to additionally learn Angular JS or Vue JS or maybe React Libraries.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2 id="placements-what-s-beneficial-">Placements (What’s beneficial)</h2>
        <p>If you have some medium or high-level real-life Android/IOS applications mentioned in your CV, then it shows that you are passionate about coding or learning coding from scratch. Also shows that you haven’t wasted 4 years of your college by doing nothing.
        <br/>
        Also it shows your creativity as well as knowledge of Android as an Operating System is also been shown.
        <br/>
        If a company visits your campus🧑‍🎓, you definitely have an edge over others as in interviews the questions are more often asked about Android system. Even if you are not good at Data Structures &amp; Algorithms📚, Android development could be your biggest advantage.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2 id="deploy-a-production">Deploy a Production</h2>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p><strong>Web</strong> →If you are a student or a developer, GitHub is an excellent platform to deploy you web based projects. You can subscribe to the GitHub Student Pack for FREE. Personally, this has helped me a lot a developer. Stay tuned!!! Visit my profile to know more.</p>
        <p><strong>Android</strong> → For hosting of apps there aren’t much free resources available. The standard way is you have to sign In Google Developer account and buy the subscription for 25$ (roughly 2000₹), then meet the Google requirements to host your app on play store.</p>
        <p><strong>Additionally</strong> → There are many free and cool website that offer you free domain name and hosting other than GitHub.
        Also you can build your .apk file from Android Studio and share them via a sharing app with your friends and colleagues rather than hosting it.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p><strong>Android</strong> → An Android Developer really requires a high-end i.e., minimum(4GB) RAM (I recommend 8GB or else you will get frustrated) <em>. Also, a minimum of i3 intel processor and a graphic card would be a plus point for developers😊.
        <em>*Web</em></em> → Only a Notepad or Visual Studio Code (for better visualization) and a simple browser would be efficiently to run the web code smoothly.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2 id="supply-vs-demand">Supply VS Demand</h2>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p>Here, Android Development has a significant edge over Web development. Let me explain you with an example.</p>
        <p><strong>Example-</strong> From the early 90’s, websites are available on the internet. But in the last decade, mobile applications are taking a boom in the market. Every day we use multiple apps in our mobiles rather than visiting a website of the same, but many are still not available.</p>
        <p>Thus, the supply is very less for an Android developer and very less for an IOS developer. But in case of web development many web developers who have literally researched in the field of web development are readily available.</p>
        <p>Thus even if you are from Tier-3 college, you can get a job in a Product Based Company with hefty package based on the skillset of an Android / IOS developer.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2 id="salary-package-">Salary💸(Package)</h2>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p>This totally depends upon Product Based or Service Based company you are placed in.</p>
        <p><strong>Product Based</strong> → In these types of companies, you usually enter as Software Engineer. You get to choose your field if you want Android or Web. Also, in Web Development you can get to choose as a Backend or Frontend developer, or a Full Stack developer. Task is assigned, you learn and go for it.
        Basically, the salary of Software Engineer ranges between <strong>6LPA to 14LPA</strong> for freshers and increased beyond.</p>
        <p><strong>Service Based</strong> → In these companies, you are entitled to a single post like Java developer, Android or Web developer, etc. Thus, your packages get divided too.
        But in Service Based companies too, Android Developer’s supply is less whereas package offered is more than normal. Usually, the package offered is in between <strong>3LPA to 8LPA</strong>.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p><br/></p>
        <p>So, Guys after reading this, I guess your doubts have been resolved regarding what to choose between Web and Android Development. Do not waste much time thinking and just go for it!!! Just master what you like &amp; you would be unstoppable🚀.</p>
        <p>I have done and continuously doing some Android and Web development projects in college and showcasing them on GitHub. Go there and star⭐ the repository if you like them!!! </p>

        PCs in the 1970s, the internet in 1990s &amp; Smartphones in 2000s revolutionized the way we do daily activities in ways never imagined before. Well another revolution is around the corner  and just half a decade or so away. <strong>AI/ML, Web 3.0, Metaverse</strong> are the fields everyone is pondering about &amp; this list of fields  gets completed with the addition of <strong>Virtual Reality (VR) &amp;  Augmented Reality (AR)</strong> and that’s the theme of our blog too! 
        <br/><br/>
        VR headsets debuted commercially just few years ago have  exponentially grown in VR “Gaming” domain and very soon  professors &amp; students will use VR for education, corporates for  conducting Virtual meeting (thus saving time and money),  companies for training employees, warehouse and factory  workers. VR is also an essential part of upcoming Metaverse.  Headsets as of now are quite expensive but I strongly believe  just as mid-ranged &amp; affordable smartphones that are presently  available, there will be mid-ranged &amp; affordable headsets as  well in the future. 
        Apple CEO, Tim Cook said, “I’m excited about AR. My view is it’s  next big thing and it will persuade our entire lives.” Imagine calling, texting, getting 3D Navigation to your  destination straight from your wearable glasses! Yes, all this is  possible because of full fledged AR glasses &amp; Silicon Valley  companies like Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft are working on  it &amp; its development has commenced. The day is not so far  when we have light-weighing AR glasses on our heads. Like VR,  AR too has applications in e-commerce, military (Microsoft  HoloLens), education; etc. This blog is an interesting read for inquisitive minds, curious to understand what VR &amp; AR holds  for us in our hands.</p>

        <strong>When is the time for a new revolution in prototyping technology ?</strong></p>
        <p>When l was having a casting class in my Mechanical Engineering college, that made me wondering with somehow a surprised face about the future of this field.</p>
        <p>Casting &amp; prototyping generally nowadays, whatever the technology invented (like 3D printing) is all about modeling something into a shape from outside, this means that something outside the matter is “restructuring” the 3D positions of specific taken control approach, like stacking thousands of 2D triangles layers in 3D printing, re-crystalline transformation in extrusion process with a mold (profile), or full melting in some other techniques like what we do in a sand casting process, here the shape is given by the shape of the sand mould, you can see obviously that what every technology of those does is inheriting the property of shape from a mould or a computer coding instructions into the matter.</p>
        <p><br/><br/></p>
        <p><strong>How does it give a wave for the future ?</strong></p>
        <p>I think when we talk about 4D printing, so we are talking about the idea that takes a very first “modern” step on the way of looking at the matter from inside while the whole used to look from outside, what this means is having a very first awesome step on the way we need to build the “casting” technology of the future.</p>
        <p>What i’m really talking about is a “casting intelligence” from inside which enable the matter to transform its shape and properties like density based on its own decisions, and when i say “its own” i mean that it takes this decision without any help or contributions from a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) or any another electrical computer whatever it’s.</p>
        <p>so the matter really has its intelligence to “think” and take a reaction or a step using its “mindset”.</p>

    <p>Cryptocurrencies have emerged in investing world as a revolutionary change and gained immense popularity because of their ability to soar or make one rich. </p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <h2 id="advantages-of-cryptocurrency">Advantages of Cryptocurrency</h2>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p><strong>Decentralization:</strong> It acts as a major advantage in the case of cryptocurrencies. Decentralization helps the creators or developers who release the coins in the  market to own a certain percent of the coin thus having control over the trends of the coin and avoiding monopoly. </p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p><strong>Secure:</strong> Cryptocurrencies are extremely secure  because the blockchain is created on difficult<br>mathematical puzzles thus making it hard to decode  and hack into.</p>
    <p><br/><br/></p>
    <h2 id="environmental-effect-of-crypto-mining">Environmental effect of Crypto Mining</h2>
    <p><br/>
    Came to no one’s notice initially but cryptocurrencies like  bitcoin consume a lot of electricity thus indirectly affecting  nature. Bitcoin especially consumes about 91 terawatt hours of electricity annually which rounds about to half a  percent of electricity consumed in the world and has been  increasing day by day. </p>
    <p><br/><br/></p>
    <h2 id="viable-solutions">Viable Solutions</h2>
    <p><br/> 
    There seem to exist “altcoins”, which are less lethal to  the environment. They differentiate from traditional  coins based on the process or technology of creation. Also, they differ by the process of the entire transaction. </p>
    <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong> uses “proof of work” protocol which is power exhausting, while “altcoins” like <strong>Ethereum</strong> use “proof  of stake” protocol which takes into account the  environmental effects. </p>
    <p>Scientists are working on methods to reduce the  power consumption to mine cryptocurrencies.  Scientists from <strong>3M</strong> have been able to devise cooling technologies for data centers.</p>

    <p><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> solves the potential flaw in digital banking known as double-spending. Let me explain double-spending through an example if a person buys a sandwich worth ten rupees, for instance, they cannot spend that same ten-rupee bill anywhere else but when the same amount is paid digitally some people can manipulate systems and spend the same ten rupees more than once, that in simple words is double spending to stop this from happening, we have banks and credit card companies acting as middlemen so they vouch for the transactions that you make and they prove that you&#39;ve already paid for something and at the same time they take  their cut of the transactions you make. Cryptocurrencies solve both these issues. Bitcoin is the first implementation of cryptocurrency in blockchain technology.</p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p><strong>Blockchain</strong> is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrencies, think of it like a computer file that stores data but this is a file across a vast network of computers and it&#39;s not exclusive to bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Blockchain has many uses, cryptocurrency is just one of them. The blockchain serves as a ledger that contains information regarding transactions. Every network in a blockchain is regularly updated at the same time, in the case of bitcoin it is  updated every 10 minutes. Once an entry has been added it  becomes immutable. 
    Blockchain is also used in other areas such as smart contracts, video games, healthcare, etc. </p>
    <p><br/></p>
    <p>In conclusion, Cryptocurrencies are becoming widely  accepted and possess a bright future ahead as a  technological field.</p>
